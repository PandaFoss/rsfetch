## rsfetch

This is a WIP rewrite of [rsfetch](https://github.com/rsfetch/rsfetch) from scratch.<br>
I've been really unhappy with the codebase now for various reasons.<br>
It's made development for rsfetch downright unpleasant at times.

## Help

`$ cargo run -- --help`

```

## Features

Currently there are 2 features. At least one must be chosen.<br>

- `nomusic`, this will cause rsfetch to not pull in the `mpd` crate, and will cause the music function to output `N/A`.
- `music`, this will cause rsfetch to pull in the `mpd` crate, and display the music info as: 

`artist - album (date) - title -- genre`
